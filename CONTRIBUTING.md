### How to setup the project

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run npm install to install dependencies
3. Create a Firebase project and fill in `.env` with its details
4. For dev testing, use start to run the server and lint to setup eslint
5. Create a PR branch with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`


### Pull Request Review Process

Before you make your PR, you should run the test script to test against the tests made. You run the tests using `npm test`. This will update any snapshots that need to be made. You should mention them if they exist in your commit. Once you're done with that, do the following:

1. Update the README.md with the details of your changes to the project. This needs to include anything related to environment variables, useful file locations and container parameters needed to run the application.
2. Submit your Pull Request. When it's been reviewed and signed-off, your PR will be merged.
